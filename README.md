**Important Considerations:**

**Blockchain Integration:** For true decentralization, you'd need to integrate with a blockchain (like Ethereum) for data storage and access control. This example simulates that decentralization for simplicity. We'll use a distributed ledger (a simple JSON file) to store course and student data. A real-world implementation would replace this with smart contracts and calls to a blockchain node.

**Security:** This code is a starting point. You MUST implement proper security measures (authentication, authorization, input validation, protection against injection attacks, etc.) before deploying this in any production environment. Consider using a more robust database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with proper access controls.

**Error Handling:** The error handling here is basic. Implement more comprehensive error logging, reporting, and user feedback mechanisms.

**Scalability:** This example is not designed for high scalability. Consider caching, load balancing, and database optimization techniques for larger user bases.

**Smart Contracts (Ethereum):** If you intend to use blockchain (Ethereum), you'll need to define and deploy smart contracts to manage course registration, access control, and grade storage. The backend would then interact with these smart contracts using a library like web3.py.

**Phase 1: Setting up the Backend (Python/Flask)**

**Install Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

cd university-cms

mkdir backend

**Create a Virtual Environment:** python -m venv venv  **# or** py -3 -m venv venv **on Windows**

Activate the Virtual Environment: **On Linux/macOS:** source venv/bin/activate **On Windows:** venv\Scripts\activate

**Install Dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt

**Set Environment Variables:** Create a .env file in your backend directory:

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # Replace with a strong, random key

LEDGER_FILE=data/ledger.json

**Run the Backend Server:** python server.py

**Phase 2: Setting up the Frontend (React)**

cd ..  # Go back to the university-cms directory

mkdir frontend

cd frontend

**Create a React App:** create-react-app

**Install Frontend Dependencies**

npm install axios react react-dom react-router-dom webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react css-loader style-loader

npm install

npm install -g concurrently **# Globally #OR ** npm install concurrently --save-dev **#locally (inside frontend)**

**Run the combined command:** 

npm run build

npm run start

**For git publish**

**Initialize a Git Repository (if not already):** 

git init

**Stage Your Changes:**

git add .

**Commit Your Changes:**

git commit -m "Your commit message here"

**Connect to Your GitHub Repository (if not already):**

git remote add origin <repository_url>

**Push Your Changes to GitHub:**

git push -u origin main

**Workflow Summary:**

git init               # (Only if not already a Git repo)

git add .              # Stage your changes

git commit -m "Your commit message"  # Commit your changes

git remote add origin <repository_url>  # (Only if not already connected)
git push -u origin main  # Push to GitHub
